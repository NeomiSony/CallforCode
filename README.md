## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Every organism on earth needs water to survive. Verbally saying whether water is good or bad isn't very simple but with water quality tests it can be measured and studied. Water quality is used to measure the condition of water through its physical, biological and chemical characteristics. The testing is done in the context of the intended use of the water. It is not a secret that the current problem of water pollution is a serious threat to the health of humanity. The reason is quite obvious since nowadays it is practically impossible to consume water without any artificial treatment being applied. What is meant here is the fact that nowadays water cannot be used in its original form as it is taken from nature. In stark contrast, water needs to undergo various stages of special treatment that prepares it for consumption by people without any harm to their health.

Water hardness is the traditional measure of the capacity of water to react with soap, hard water requiring considerably more soap to produce a lather. Hard water often produces a noticeable deposit of precipitate (e.g. insoluble metals, soaps or salts) in containers. It is not caused by a single substance but by a variety of dissolved polyvalent metallic ions, predominantly calcium and magnesium cations, although other cations (e.g. aluminum, barium, iron, manganese, strontium and zinc) also contribute. Hardness is most commonly expressed as milligrams of calcium carbonate equivalent per liter.

The stearates formed in the above equations reduce the capacity of water to react with soap. environmental factor, which appears to be influencing mortality, in particular.

DISADVANTAGES OF HARD-WATER

In the past five decades or so evidence has been accumulating about a cardiovascular mortality, and this is the hardness of the drinking water. In addition, several epidemiological investigations have demonstrated the relation between risk for cardiovascular disease, growth retardation, reproductive failure, and other health problems with hardness of drinking water or its content of magnesium and calcium. Refer to the Appendix section for further details of the same. 

## ABSTRACT

Smart solutions for water quality monitoring are gaining importance with advancements in technology. This project aims at informing consumers of the mineral composition of the water that they use. The inhabitants of a residential society or building can monitor the water quality and take required action by informing the concerned authorities.
Highlights of this project include a user friendly dashboard with easily understandable visualizations to understand the quality of water used on a regular basis. The IBM Cloud platform that is used here is easily accessible by a consumer at any time which increases its functionality and it also facilitates easy migration to other Cloud platforms.
For this particular undertaking, our focus is on monitoring the total dissolved salts(TDS) present in water. Additional details regarding the pH of water and the real time values of temperature and humidity is displayed as well.
