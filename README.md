## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Every organism on earth needs water to survive. Verbally saying whether water is good or bad isn't very simple but with water quality tests it can be measured and studied. Water quality is used to measure the condition of water through its physical, biological and chemical characteristics. The testing is done in the context of the intended use of the water. It is not a secret that the current problem of water pollution is a serious threat to the health of humanity. The reason is quite obvious since nowadays it is practically impossible to consume water without any artificial treatment being applied. What is meant here is the fact that nowadays water cannot be used in its original form as it is taken from nature. In stark contrast, water needs to undergo various stages of special treatment that prepares it for consumption by people without any harm to their health.

Water hardness is the traditional measure of the capacity of water to react with soap, hard water requiring considerably more soap to produce a lather. Hard water often produces a noticeable deposit of precipitate (e.g. insoluble metals, soaps or salts) in containers. It is not caused by a single substance but by a variety of dissolved polyvalent metallic ions, predominantly calcium and magnesium cations, although other cations (e.g. aluminum, barium, iron, manganese, strontium and zinc) also contribute. Hardness is most commonly expressed as milligrams of calcium carbonate equivalent per liter.
